### Plan for Releasing the APK:

1. **Update Version in `pubspec.yaml`**:
   - Ensure the version number is updated to reflect the new release (e.g., increment to 1.3.7).

2. **Configure Firebase in `firebase.json`**:
   - Verify that the Firebase configuration is correct for the Android app, including the project ID and app ID.

3. **Check Splash Screen Configuration in `flutter_native_splash.yaml`**:
   - Ensure the splash screen image and color settings are appropriate for the release.

4. **Verify Launcher Icons in `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml`**:
   - Confirm that the launcher icon image path is correct and that the icons are set up for all platforms.

5. **Build the APK**:
   - Execute the command to build the APK using Flutter.

6. **Test the APK**:
   - Install the APK on a device or emulator to ensure it functions correctly.

7. **Prepare for Release**:
   - Ensure all necessary files are included and that the app meets the requirements for submission to the Play Store.

### Follow-up Steps:

- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
